# Strengths Test

Basically this is the same shit as psychic cold-reading and astrology. Say something everyone will instantly believe applies to them. And consultants got paid a fortune to produce this nonsense. Jobs for the rich, not for the many !

This is a bogus psychometric test, that was put online and used by thousands in 2013.

This project is to rebuild the original code used in the fake test, so that me and you can learn from it, and the mistakes it made and how it mislead thousands. I also wonder how much money was paid for an organisation to use this test ? The mind boggles.

Notes:

An American psychology organisation has told a UK government agency to stop using a personality test on jobseekers because it is a failure. The Behavioural Insight team, or "nudge" unit, which was created by David Cameron in 2010 to help people "make better choices", has been accused by the Ohio-based VIA Institute on Character of bad practice after civil servants used VIA's personality tests in pilot experiments in Essex despite being refused permission to do so.

The £520,000-a-year Cabinet Office unit was told by VIA – whose members devised the personality test – to stop using the questionnaire because... it had failed its scientific validation.

This "test" uses Barnum Questions also known as the Barnum effect.
The Barnum effect, also called the Forer effect, is a common psychological phenomenon whereby individuals will give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically to them but that are, in fact, vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people.
